# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**AlBank** helps low-income users (retirees, social welfare recipients, students) analyze their bank statements to detect fraud, abusive direct debits, and anomalies in recurring charges to regain financial control.

**Context**: launch in the context of a 2-week MVP sprint at Le Wagon bootcamp finale. Team of 3, 1 experienced ex-PM, 2 more junior.

## Commands

```bash
bin/rails server                           # Dev server
bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed     # Setup database
bin/rails test                             # All tests
bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb    # Single file
bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb:10 # Single test (by line)
rubocop -a                                 # Lint + auto-fix
bin/rails console                          # Rails console
```

## Domain Model

```
User -> Statement -> Expense -> Opportunity
                        |           |
                     Category <- Standard
```

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **User** | Authenticated user (Devise) |
| **Statement** | Monthly bank statement with date |
| **Expense** | Line item with subtotal, linked to a Category |
| **Category** | Classification (e.g., "Utilities") with keywords for matching |
| **Standard** | Benchmark for a Category (average/min/max amounts) |
| **Opportunity** | Savings potential: links Expense to Standard, status: `pending` → `contacted` → `completed` |

**Key method**: `Opportunity#savings` = expense.subtotal - standard.average_amount
